# Tennis-matchs-outcome-prediction

This repo presents a data science work where I leverage a tennis matches dataset, to analyse statistically the deciding factors of a tennis match through a dataset that comprises tennis matches ranging from 2000 to 2024, which include a wide range of features (field, tournament stage, ranking pts ect..). Lastly, I attempt to use an ML model to predict the winner of a match using Machine learning models.

# Download the data

the dataset is fully open to the public and is directly accessible through [Tennis matches](http://tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php). 

If you run the script 'data_download.py', a new folder called tennis_data will be created containing two subfolder ATP and WTP, each one if them will contains individual xlsx file for each yearly season. Each recorder indicates a match played, the columns indicate the match context (tournament name, tournament stage, field, winner, loser ect..)
